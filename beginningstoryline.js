As a senior desperately preparing for finals, you had nodded off over your math textbook, succumbing to exhaustion. \nNow, with the lights extinguished, a chilling question lingers: Are you truly the sole occupant of this sprawling, shadowy building?\nSurveying the sturdy partition walls that enclose you, separating the floors and ceilings of the former department store that is now transformed into a labyrinth of classrooms, you can't help but feel like a lab mouse navigating a complex maze.\nYou need to get out of here!`
